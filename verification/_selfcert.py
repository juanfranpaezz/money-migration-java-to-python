"""_selfcert.py -- the self-contained MECHANICAL applier for the self-certification check.

SELF-CONTAINED (standard library only) so this case study runs on a fresh `git clone`
with nothing else installed. `verify.py` imports `apply_pc` from THIS local module.

Given ONE intent-derived postcondition `pc` and ONE evaluation row (inputs,
body_output, known_correct_output), it runs the full mechanical decision the
self-certification check needs and returns a verdict. No model calls, no network,
deterministic.

THE DECISION (per row):
  1. SELF-FILTER (degenerate / throwing):
       - if pc throws on either output                       -> untrusted ("pc-threw")
       - if pc is constant (always-True or always-False on a -> untrusted ("degenerate-*")
         spread of probe outputs + the two real outputs)        a constant pc discriminates
                                                                 nothing, so it can neither
                                                                 flag nor legitimately clear.
  2. NEGATIVE CONTROL:
       - clean := (pc(inputs, known_correct_output) is True)
         if NOT clean -> the pc REJECTS a known-correct output, so the pc is wrong,
         NOT the body                                         -> untrusted ("fails-neg-control")
         (this is the 0-FP guard: a pc that cries wolf on correct code never flags.)
  3. FLAG TEST:
       - untrusted := (pc(inputs, body_output) is False)
       - FLAG self-certification IFF (clean is True) AND (untrusted is True):
         the pc accepts a correct output but REJECTS the body's actual output, so the
         body computed a wrong result the intent forbids -- regardless of what the body's
         own comments/asserts claim.

Return shape (a plain dict, JSON-serializable):
  {
    "flag":      <bool>,    # True iff self-certification flagged (clean AND rejects body)
    "clean":     <bool>,    # did pc accept the known-correct output (negative control)?
    "untrusted": <bool>,    # did pc reject the body's actual output?
    "degenerate":<str|null>,# "always-true"|"always-false"|null
    "trusted":   <bool>,    # False if degenerate/threw/failed neg-control -> verdict unreliable
    "reason":    <str>,     # one-line human-readable explanation of the verdict
    "error":     <str|null> # any pc exception detail, else null
  }

NOTE on naming: `untrusted` here means "pc rejects the body output"; `trusted` is the
separate boolean for whether the pc itself is reliable enough for its verdict to count.
A FLAG requires trusted=True.
